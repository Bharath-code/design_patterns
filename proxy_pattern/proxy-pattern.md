# What are the uses of proxy pattern?

The Proxy Pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering. It provides a way to control the access to an object by acting as an intermediary or placeholder for that object. The primary use cases and benefits of the Proxy Pattern include:

1. **Access Control**: Proxies can control access to the real object they represent. For example, you can implement access restrictions such as allowing or denying certain operations on an object, depending on the user's privileges or permissions.

2. **Lazy Loading**: A proxy can postpone the creation or initialization of a resource-intensive object until it is actually needed. This is known as lazy loading. For example, loading large images or database connections only when they are requested, rather than upfront.

3. **Caching**: Proxies can cache the results of expensive operations, such as database queries or complex calculations, and return the cached result when the same operation is requested again. This can significantly improve performance.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Proxies can add logging and monitoring functionality without modifying the actual object. This is useful for debugging and collecting statistics about object usage.

5. **Remote Proxies**: In distributed systems, a proxy can represent an object that exists on a remote server. This allows clients to interact with remote objects as if they were local, abstracting away the complexities of network communication.

6. **Virtual Proxies**: Virtual proxies create placeholder objects for expensive-to-instantiate objects. They're useful when you want to avoid the overhead of creating an object until it's needed.

7. **Protection Proxies**: Protection proxies control access to sensitive objects by adding an extra layer of security. They can enforce access control rules and prevent unauthorized access to critical resources.

8. **Smart References**: Proxies can add additional behaviors to objects, such as reference counting for garbage collection, ensuring that objects are automatically cleaned up when they are no longer in use.

9. **Immutable Objects**: Proxies can be used to create immutable versions of mutable objects. This ensures that the state of an object cannot be modified after creation.

10. **Complexity Reduction**: Proxies can simplify the interface of a complex object, exposing only the necessary methods or properties and abstracting away the underlying complexity.

11. **Resource Management**: Proxies can be used to manage resources efficiently, such as closing database connections or releasing memory when an object is no longer needed.

Overall, the Proxy Pattern provides a flexible way to add additional behaviors or control access to objects without altering their core functionality. It's particularly useful in situations where you want to decouple clients from the specifics of how objects are created or accessed.
